 
1. Why did the programmer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a cyber attack and couldn't CTRL+Z his financial troubles!

2. Why did the computer go to the doctor? It had a virus and needed a byte!

3. Why did the software engineer always bring a ladder to work? Because he was afraid of falling into the "cloud"!

4. Why did the cyber security expert bring a flashlight to work? In case of a "dark web" emergency!
