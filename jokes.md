 
Sure, here are four jokes related to software engineering and cybersecurity:

1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode?
   Because light attracts bugs!

2. Why did the developer go broke?
   Because he lost his domain in a phishing scam!

3. Why did the computer go to the doctor?
   Because it had a virus!

4. Why did the programmer always carry a ladder?
   In case he needed to access the cloud!

I hope these jokes bring a smile to your face!
