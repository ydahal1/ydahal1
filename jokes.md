 
Sure, here are four jokes related to software engineering and cybersecurity:

1. Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs!

2. Why did the programmer always wear two different shoes? In case he needed to debug!

3. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? To scale the firewall!

4. Why did the developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a DDoS attack!

Please note that these jokes are meant to be light-hearted and not intended to offend anyone.
