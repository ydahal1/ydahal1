 
Sure, here are four jokes related to software engineering and cyber security:

1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

2. Why was the computer cold? It left its Windows open!

3. What do you call a hacker who can't get into any systems? A lack-toaster-intolerant!

4. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to work? To reach new heights in protecting the network!

Hope these bring a smile to your face!
