 
1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet and couldn't DNS to save his life!

2. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to the office? Because he heard the systems were always on the cloud, so he wanted to climb up and fix them!

3. Why did the computer catch a cold? It left its Windows open!

4. Why was the software engineer always hungry? Because he constantly mistook "byte" for "bite"!
