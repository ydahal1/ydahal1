 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing scam!

2. Why did the computer catch a virus? Because it didn't use protection (firewall)!

3. Why did the programmer quit his job? Because he didn't get arrays (a raise)!

4. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
