 
Sure! Here are four jokes related to software engineering and cybersecurity:

1. Why did the programmer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing attack.

2. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? Because he heard the system had high-level security.

3. Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 == Dec 25.

4. Why did the software engineer get stuck at the grocery store? Because the shopping cart had a buffer overflow.

Note: Please keep in mind that these jokes are meant to be lighthearted and may not be suitable for all audiences.
