 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke?
Because he lost his domain in a cyber attack and couldn't afford to renew it!

2. Why did the computer go to the doctor?
Because it had a virus and needed a byte!

3. Why did the developer go broke?
Because he kept forgetting to return his pointers and lost all his memory!

4. Why do programmers prefer dark mode?
Because light attracts bugs and they like to keep their code bug-free!
