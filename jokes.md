 
1. Why do software engineers prefer gardening? Because they like to "debug" their plants and watch them "grow"!

2. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? Because they heard the company had a lot of "high-level" security!

3. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because they lost their "cache" flow and couldn't "compile" enough money!

4. Why do security experts never get into fights? Because they always "encrypt" their personal data and "firewall" their emotions!
