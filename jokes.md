 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke?
Because he lost all his cache!

2. Why did the developer go broke?
Because he couldn't find a bug in his code!

3. Why did the cyber security expert always go to bed early?
Because she wanted to catch some bytes!

4. Why did the software engineer always bring a ladder to work?
Because he heard the code had a lot of bugs and he wanted to debug it from the top down!
