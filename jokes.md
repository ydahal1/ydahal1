 
1. Why did the programmer always carry a screwdriver? Because he was always "debugging"!

2. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed an "antivirus"!

3. Why did the developer go broke? Because he lost all his "cache"!

4. Why was the computer cold? Because it left its Windows open!
