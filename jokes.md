 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost all his cache!

2. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to work? Because he heard the system had a lot of firewalls!

3. Why did the programmer always carry a band-aid? Because he kept getting cuts from all the sharp objects in his code!

4. Why did the computer catch a cold? Because it forgot to install an anti-virus program!
