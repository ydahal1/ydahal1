 
1. Why did the programmer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a cyber attack!

2. Why did the developer go broke? Because he couldn't find a bug in his code, so he offered a bounty to anyone who could!

3. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? Because he heard the system had a lot of firewalls!

4. Why did the software engineer always carry a pencil and paper? In case he had to draw a sketchy network diagram!
