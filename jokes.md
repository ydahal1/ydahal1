 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

2. Why did the cybersecurity expert get thrown out of the theater? He was trying to hack the mainframe!

3. Why did the programmer quit his job? Because he didn't get arrays!

4. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus - it was feeling a bit "bytey"!
