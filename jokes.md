2. Why did the programmer always carry a ladder? Because he wanted to reach the highest level of encryption!

3. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a broom to the office? Because he wanted to sweep for bugs!

4. Why do programmers prefer iOS development over Android development? Because on iOS, there are fewer bugs to squash, and more apples to eat!
