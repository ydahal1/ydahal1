 
1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? 
Because light attracts bugs!

2. Why did the programmer go broke? 
Because he lost his domain in a phishing attack!

3. Why was the computer cold? 
Because it left its Windows open!

4. Why did the programmer always carry a ladder? 
Because he wanted to reach the "cloud"!
