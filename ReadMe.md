I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing scam!

2. Why did the programmer always carry a ladder? Because he wanted to reach the highest level of encryption!

3. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a broom to the office? Because he wanted to sweep for bugs!

4. Why do programmers prefer iOS development over Android development? Because on iOS, there are fewer bugs to squash, and more apples to eat!
