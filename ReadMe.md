I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he used up all his cache!
2. Why did the cyber security expert always carry a pencil and paper? In case he needed to draw a firewall!
3. Why was the computer cold? It left its Windows open!
4. Why was the software developer always calm? Because they had good exception handling skills!
