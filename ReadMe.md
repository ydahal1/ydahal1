I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in the spam filter!

2. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to the office? Because he wanted to reach the highest level of security - the cloud!

3. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

4. Why did the cybersecurity expert always carry a pencil and paper? In case he needed to draw his own firewall!
