I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!
2. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? To secure the "top-level" access!
3. Why was the computer cold? It left its Windows open!
4. Why did the programmer always carry a spoon? In case there was a byte to eat!
