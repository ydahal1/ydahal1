I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the programmer go broke? Because he lost his cache!
2. Why did the web developer walk out of his job? He didn't get arrays!
3. Why did the security guard bring a ladder to work? To reach the firewall!
4. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
