I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

2. I asked a cyber security expert if my password was strong enough. He said, "It's got to be at least eight characters long and include uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols." I replied, "Perfect, my password is 'password123'!"

3. Why do programmers prefer iOS development over Android? Because on iOS, there are no Java exceptions!

4. Why did the computer catch a virus? Because it had a bad driver!
