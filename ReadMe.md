I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why couldn't the computer take its hat off? Because it had a bad case of CAPTCHA!

2. Why did the programmer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing attack!

3. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

4. Why did the computer go to the doctor? It had a virus and needed an injection of anti-virus!
