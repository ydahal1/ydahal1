I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing attack!

2. Why do programmers prefer iOS development over Android? Because on iOS, there are no Java exceptions to catch!

3. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to the office? Because he heard the system had a high firewall!

4. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed some anti-virus software!
