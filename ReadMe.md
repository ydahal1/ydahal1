I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

2. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus!

3. Why was the JavaScript developer sad? Because he didn't know how to "null" his feelings.

4. Why was the computer cold? It left its Windows open!
