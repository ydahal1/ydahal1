I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost all his cache!
2. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
3. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to work? To reach new heights in network security!
4. Why did the developer go broke? Because he always forgot to 'return' his borrowed money!
