I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the computer go to the doctor? It had a virus!

2. Why did the programmer always wear glasses? Because they couldn't C#!

3. Why was the math book sad? Because it had too many problems!

4. Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!
