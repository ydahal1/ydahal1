I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a DDoS attack!

2. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

3. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus!

4. Why don't programmers like nature? Because they prefer the artificial intelligence!
