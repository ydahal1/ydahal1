I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
2. I asked my computer to tell me a joke about cyber security, but it kept saying "Access Denied."
3. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he used up all his cache!
4. I told my computer I wanted a password that was easy to remember but also secure. It replied, "Sorry, that password is already taken."
