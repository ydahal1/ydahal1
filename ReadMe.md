I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
2. Why did the cyber security expert break up with his girlfriend? She kept saying "password" instead of "I love you".
3. What do you call a hacker who doesn't know how to code? A script kiddie.
4. Why did the software engineer quit his job? He didn't get arrays.
