I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the programmer always carry a flashlight? Because he preferred to debug in the dark!

2. Why did the hacker bring a ladder to their job interview? Because they wanted to climb up the firewall!

3. Why did the developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

4. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus... and the only cure was a byte of medicine!
