I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing attack!

2. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a bad case of CAPTCHA!

3. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

4. Why did the hacker break up with their partner? They found someone else to CTRL+C and CTRL+V with!
