I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a DDoS attack!

2. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to the office? Because he heard the system had a lot of bugs!

3. Why did the software engineer always carry a pencil and paper? In case he needed to draw a "byte"!

4. Why did the cybersecurity analyst always bring a mirror to work? To reflect any suspicious activity back to the hackers!
