I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing attack!

2. Why did the computer virus go to art school? It wanted to learn how to create more sophisticated attacks!

3. Why did the programmer go broke? Because he couldn't find a byte to eat!

4. Why did the cybersecurity expert always carry a pen and paper? In case he needed to write down a malware-ware!
