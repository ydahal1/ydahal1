I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing attack!

2. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed a byte!

3. Why did the software engineer always bring a pencil and paper to the gym? Because he wanted to do some code exercises!

4. Why did the cyber security specialist bring a ladder to work? Because he wanted to scale the firewall!
