I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer always carry a sweater? Because they were afraid of catching a bug!

2. Why did the computer go to the doctor? It had a virus and needed to be cured!

3. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? To reach new heights in network security!

4. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs and they prefer to code in the dark!
