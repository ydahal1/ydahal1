I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
Sure, here are four jokes related to software engineering and cybersecurity:

1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet.

2. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

3. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to the office? To reach new heights in network security!

4. Why was the computer cold? It left its Windows open!

Hope these bring a smile to your face!
