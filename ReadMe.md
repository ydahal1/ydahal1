I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing scheme!

2. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? Because they heard the system had a high level of "firewall" protection!

3. Why don't programmers like nature? Because they prefer working in the "cloud"!

4. Why did the software engineer always carry a math book? Because they liked to "code" with their algorithms!
