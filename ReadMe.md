I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs!
2. Why did the programmer go broke? Because he lost all his cache!
3. Why did the security expert bring a ladder to work? To reach the higher-level security!
4. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed a byte!
