I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the light attracts bugs!

2. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus!

3. What did the cyber security expert say to the suspicious software? "I've got my firewalls up, you'll never get past my encryption!"

4. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing scam!
