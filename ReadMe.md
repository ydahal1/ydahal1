Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he used up all his cache!
2. Why was the computer cold? It left its Windows open.
3. Why did the cybersecurity expert always carry a pencil and paper? In case they needed to draw a firewall.
