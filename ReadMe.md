I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a DDoS attack.

2. Why did the cyber security expert always carry a ladder? To reach new heights in network security!

3. Why did the software engineer get kicked out of the party? He kept talking about his favorite algorithm and nobody could decode what he was saying!

4. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed a byte!
