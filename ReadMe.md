I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer always carry a pen and paper? Because he couldn't Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V in real life!

2. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the light mode is too bright, it's like staring directly into the source code!

3. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? Because they heard the servers had high security patches!

4. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet and couldn't afford to renew it!
