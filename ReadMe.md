I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the light attracts bugs.
2. Why was the computer cold? It left its Windows open.
3. Why did the cyber security expert break up with their calculator? They couldn't count on it to protect their data.
4. Why did the programmer quit their job at the bakery? They couldn't handle the cookie security risks.
