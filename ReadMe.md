I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!

2. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost all his cache!

3. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to work? Because he wanted to scale the firewall!

4. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
