I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet.

2. Why did the cyber security expert always carry a pencil and paper? Because he wanted to draw his own firewalls!

3. Why did the software engineer always carry a ladder with him? Because he wanted to reach the cloud!

4. Why did the programmer get stuck in the shower? Because the instructions on the shampoo bottle said, "Lather, Rinse, Repeat," and he kept debugging it!
