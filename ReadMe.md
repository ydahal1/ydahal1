I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

2. How does a computer scientist keep their computer secure? They encrypt-it!

3. Why did the developer go broke? Because they lost their domain in a phishing scam!

4. Why did the SQL query go to therapy? Because it had too many relationship issues!
