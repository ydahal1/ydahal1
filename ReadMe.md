I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

2. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? Because they heard the system had a lot of high-level security!

3. What do you call a software engineer who can't spell? A typo coder!

4. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed a byte!
