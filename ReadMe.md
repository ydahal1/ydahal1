I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

2. Why did the cyber security expert always carry a pencil and paper? In case they needed to draw a quick firewall!

3. Why did the software engineer bring a ladder to the office? Because they heard the code had a lot of bugs!

4. How do you confuse a cyber criminal? Put them in a room with multiple doors labeled "exit" and watch them try to escape using the wrong one every time!
