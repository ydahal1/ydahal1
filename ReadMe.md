I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the programmer always carry a screwdriver? Because he wanted to debug the hardware too!

2. How does a computer programmer communicate with others? In binary code, they speak 0s and 1s!

3. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed a byte!

4. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
