I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

2. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? Because they heard the system had high-level security!

3. Why did the software developer go broke? Because they didn't have enough cache!

4. Why don't programmers like nature? Because they prefer artificial intelligence!
