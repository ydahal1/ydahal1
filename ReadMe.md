I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

2. Why did the programmer always carry a screwdriver? In case he needed to open a "Java"!

3. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to the office? To reach the highest level of encryption!

4. How do software engineers party? They throw exception-al parties, but only when they catch the right errors!
