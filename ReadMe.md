I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a cyber sale!

2. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? Because they heard the system had a lot of bugs!

3. Why did the software engineer quit their job? Because they couldn't find a secure connection with their boss!

4. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because they like to code in the shadows and stay one step ahead of the cyber attackers!
