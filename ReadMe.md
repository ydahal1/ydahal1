I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he kept debugging his bank account!

2. Why did the computer go to art school? Because it had a lot of bugs to "draw" out!

3. What's the most used language in programming? Profanity! It's the first thing developers learn when their code doesn't work!

4. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? Because they heard the system had a lot of "high-level" security!
