I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a DDoS attack!

2. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed a byte!

3. Why did the cybersecurity expert always carry a flashlight? Because he wanted to shed some light on the dark web!

4. Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs!
