I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the light attracts bugs!

2. Why did the developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a DDoS attack!

3. Why don't programmers like nature? They prefer artificial intelligence!

4. Why did the security analyst bring a ladder to work? Because they heard the system had a few "high-level" vulnerabilities!
