I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus!
2. Why did the programmer break up with their significant other? They didn't understand their "code" language.
3. Why did the software developer go broke? Because they lost their domain in a cyber attack!
4. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
