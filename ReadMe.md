I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!

2. Why did the programmer quit his job? Because he didn't get arrays!

3. Why did the cyber security expert always bring a pencil and paper to work? In case they needed to draw a firewall!

4. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed a byte!
