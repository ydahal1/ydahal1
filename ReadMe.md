I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

2. Why did the hacker bring a ladder to the data center? Because they heard the password was "W1nd0w5"!

3. Why did the developer go broke? Because he couldn't find a bug in his code, but the bug found him!

4. Why did the cybersecurity expert always carry a flashlight? Because they liked to enlighten the dark web!
