I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing scam!

2. Why did the computer catch a virus? Because it didn't use protection (firewall)!

3. Why did the programmer quit his job? Because he didn't get arrays (a raise)!

4. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
