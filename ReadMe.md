I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a DDoS attack!

2. Why did the computer go to the doctor? It had a virus and couldn't stop coughing up spam!

3. Why did the developer go broke? He kept getting paid in bitcoins, but they kept disappearing due to a bug in his wallet!

4. Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!
