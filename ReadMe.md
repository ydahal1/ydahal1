I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

2. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to the office? Because he wanted to reach new heights in network security!

3. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

4. Why did the software engineer always carry a towel? Because in the world of coding, you should always know where your towel (debugging tool) is!
