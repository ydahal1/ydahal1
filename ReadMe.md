I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer always carry a pencil and paper? Because he couldn't Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V in real life!

2. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to work? Because he heard the security was always on a higher level!

3. Why did the software engineer quit his job? He didn't get arrays!

4. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
