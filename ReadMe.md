I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer always carry a pencil and paper? Because he couldn't resist the urge to draw his own "interface"!

2. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to work? Because he wanted to scale the firewall!

3. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

4. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
