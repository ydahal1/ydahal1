I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing attack!

2. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to work? Because he wanted to scale the firewall!

3. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

4. Why was the computer cold? It left its Windows open!
