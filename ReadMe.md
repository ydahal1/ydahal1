I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed a byte!

2. Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!

3. Why did the computer take up acting? Because it had great hardware, but no software!

4. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? Because they heard the system had a lot of "loopholes"!
