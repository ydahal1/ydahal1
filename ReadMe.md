I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
2. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing attack!
3. Why did the developer go broke buying a new computer? Because he couldn't find the any-key!
4. Why did the security analyst always carry a ladder? Because he wanted to reach the highest level of encryption!
