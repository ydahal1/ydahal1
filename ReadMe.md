I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the programmer always carry a pencil and paper? Because he heard it was the best way to draw a blank!

2. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to the office? Because he heard they needed to reach new heights in network security!

3. Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 equals Dec 25 in binary!

4. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed a byte!
