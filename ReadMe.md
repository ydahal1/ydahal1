1. Why did the software engineer refuse to go out in the sun? Because he was afraid of the open source.
2. Why did the cyber security expert cross the road? To get to the other side of the firewall.

4. Why did the hacker quit his job? He didn't get a raise, but he did get access to the company's confidential files.
