I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

2. How does a computer programmer break up with their partner? They say, "It's not you, it's me. You deserve someone better... and I deserve someone with better code!"

3. Why did the computer go to the doctor? It had a virus and needed a byte!

4. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a map to their job interview? Because they wanted to show they could navigate through all the firewalls!
