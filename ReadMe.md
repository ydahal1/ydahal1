I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

2. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he didn't have enough cache!

3. Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!

4. Why did the cyber security analyst bring a ladder to work? Because they heard they needed to scale the firewall!
