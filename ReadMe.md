I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a cyber attack.

2. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because it's easier on the "I"s.

3. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to the office? To scale the firewall!

4. Why did the software engineer always carry a pen and paper? In case he needed to write some Java script!
