I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

2. Why did the cyber security expert always carry a pen and paper? Because he wanted to catch all the hacks in a sketch!

3. Why did the software engineer refuse to go on a date? Because he didn't want to be caught in an infinite loop of love!

4. Why did the cyber security specialist bring a ladder to work? Because he heard the system had a lot of firewalls!
