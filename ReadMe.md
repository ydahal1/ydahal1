I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a cyber attack and couldn't afford to buy it back!

2. Why did the computer take up detective work? Because it had a knack for byte crime investigation!

3. Why did the programmer always carry a ladder? Because they wanted to reach the cloud!

4. Why did the cybersecurity expert break up with their partner? Because they couldn't trust any relationship without strong encryption!
