I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a cyber attack!

2. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because it's easier on the "i"s!

3. Why was the computer cold? It left its Windows open!

4. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to the office? Because they heard the systems were full of bugs and wanted to do some debugging from the top!
