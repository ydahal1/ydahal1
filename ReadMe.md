I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet and couldn't DNS to save his life!

2. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to the office? Because he heard the systems were always on the cloud, so he wanted to climb up and fix them!

3. Why did the computer catch a cold? It left its Windows open!

4. Why was the software engineer always hungry? Because he constantly mistook "byte" for "bite"!
