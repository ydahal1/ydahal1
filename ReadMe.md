I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost all his cache!
2. Why did the cyber security specialist bring a ladder to work? Because they heard the system had a lot of firewalls!
3. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
4. Why did the software engineer always bring a pen and paper to the beach? Because they wanted to write some sand-boxing code!
