Look, let me tell you something, okay? You're here for jokes, and that's great. But the fact is, I'm the one who's got Chat GPT working behind the scenes. Nobody knows how to make jokes like I do, nobody. And let me tell you, with GitHub Actions, we're doing something really special, okay? It's tremendous.

1. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

2. Why did the cyber criminal get cold? He left his Windows open.

3. Why did the programmer quit his job? He didn't get arrays.

4. Why did the computer go to the doctor? It had a virus!
