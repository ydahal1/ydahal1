I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost all his cache!
2. Why was the cyber security expert always calm? Because they had everything under Ctrl!
3. Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs!
4. Why did the software engineer get stuck in the shower? Because the shampoo bottle said, "Lather, Rinse, Repeat," but he couldn't find the "Exit" button!
