I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
Sure, here are four jokes related to software engineering and cybersecurity:

1. Why did the developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

2. Why did the computer take up singing? Because it had perfect pitch control!

3. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? Because he wanted to level up the security!

4. Why did the programmer quit his job? Because he didn't get arrays of opportunities!

Note: Jokes are subjective, and humor can vary from person to person.
