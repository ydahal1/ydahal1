I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus! 

2. Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#! 

3. Why did the developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet! 

4. Why did the cybersecurity expert refuse to play hide and seek? Because nobody can ever find him, he's always in incognito mode!
