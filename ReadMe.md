I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a DDoS attack!

2. How does a computer programmer get out of a locked room? They use a "key" logger!

3. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder? Because they wanted to climb up the fireWALL!

4. Why did the developer go broke? Because he kept spending all his cache!
