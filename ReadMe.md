I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

2. Why did the insecure website go to therapy? Because it had low self-SSL-esteem!

3. Why was the computer cold? It left its Windows open!

4. Why did the programmer always carry a ladder? Because he wanted to reach the highest levels of cloud computing!
