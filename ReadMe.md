Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing scam!

2. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

3. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed an antivirus!

4. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? Because they heard the system had a lot of firewalls!
