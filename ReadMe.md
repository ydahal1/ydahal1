I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why don't programmers like nature? Because they prefer artificial intelligence!

2. Why was the computer cold? It left its Windows open!

3. Why did the developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing attack!

4. Why was the math book sad? Because it had too many problems! (A joke about debugging code!)
