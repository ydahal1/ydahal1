I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a cyber attack!

2. Why did the programmer always carry a ladder with him? In case he needed to scale the firewall!

3. Why did the cybersecurity specialist bring a bird to work? Because it was an expert at tweeting about vulnerabilities!

4. Why was the computer cold? It left its Windows open!
