I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the programmer quit his job? He didn't get arrays.
2. Why do hackers wear hoodies? Because they want to stay incognito-ito.
3. Why did the cyber security expert scold his computer? It was caught phishing in the wrong pond.
4. Why do software engineers always mix up Halloween and Christmas? Because Oct 31 equals Dec 25.
