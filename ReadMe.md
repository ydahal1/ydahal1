I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he kept spending all his cache!

2. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed a byte!

3. Why did the cybersecurity expert always carry a pencil and paper? Because he wanted to draw his own firewall!

4. Why did the software engineer always bring a ladder to work? Because he heard the code had a lot of bugs!
