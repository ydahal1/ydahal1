I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost all his cache!
2. Why did the cyber security expert get kicked out of the zoo? He was caught trying to hack the lion's mane-frame!
3. Why did the programmer always carry a screwdriver? Because he was a bit-oriented guy in a byte-oriented world!
4. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a bad case of viruses and needed a byte of medicine!
