I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing attack!

2. Why did the computer virus go to art school? It wanted to become a master of malware-ination!

3. Why did the developer go broke? He lost all his cache!

4. Why did the programmer always bring a ladder to work? Because he heard he needed to climb the firewall!
