I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a phishing attack!

2. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed some malware-tylenol!

3. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

4. Why did the software engineer refuse to go outside? Because the API documentation said, "Stay indoors, infinite loop detected!"
