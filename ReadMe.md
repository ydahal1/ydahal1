I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer always bring a ladder to work? Because they wanted to reach the highest level of code security!

2. Why did the cyber security expert get into stand-up comedy? Because they found cracking jokes much easier than cracking codes!

3. Why was the computer cold? It left its Windows open!

4. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because they lost all their cache!
