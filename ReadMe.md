I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
Sure, here are four jokes related to software engineering and cyber security:

1. Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!

2. Why did the programmer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet with a hacker!

3. What do you call a hacker who doesn't smell bad? A "shower hacker"!

4. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his root access!
