I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

2. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to work? Because they heard the system had a lot of "high-level" threats!

3. Why did the programmer always carry a screwdriver? Because they heard you should always "debug" your code!

4. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed a byte!
