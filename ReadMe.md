I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed to be debugged!

2. Why did the software engineer always carry a pen and paper? In case they needed to draw a quick "flow chart" of their thoughts!

3. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to work? Because they heard the security was "top-notch" and wanted to climb over it!

4. Why did the software developer always carry an umbrella? Because they heard their code had a lot of "bugs" and they didn't want to get wet when it rained "errors"!
