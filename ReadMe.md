I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a bet!

2. Why did the cybersecurity expert bring a ladder to work? To reach new heights in encryption!

3. Why did the software engineer always carry a compass? Because he wanted to make sure his code was always heading in the right direction!

4. Why did the cyber security analyst always have a flashlight with him? Because he wanted to shine a light on any potential vulnerabilities!
