I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software engineer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a DDoS attack!

2. Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs!

3. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to work? Because he heard the system had a lot of "firewalls"!

4. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he lost his "cache" flow!
