I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the developer go broke? Because he didn't have enough cache!

2. Why did the programmer always carry a screwdriver? Because he was a bit-rot repairman!

3. Why did the scarecrow become a cyber security expert? Because he was outstanding in his field!

4. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
