Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he lost his domain in a cyber attack!

2. What do you call a hacker who doesn't like coffee? Decaf-feinated!

3. Why did the programmer quit his job? He didn't get arrays!

4. Why did the computer go to the doctor? Because it had a virus and needed byte-sized medicine!
