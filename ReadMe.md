I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he kept trying to make cents out of bugs!

2. Why did the computer catch a cold? Because it left its Windows open!

3. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to work? Because he heard the system had a few security breaches!

4. Why did the programmer always carry a screwdriver? In case he needed to "debug" the hardware!
