I know you are here for jokes, No worries !!
Here are some new ones. Keep checking back for more laugh-out-loud jokes, brought to you by the dynamic duo of Chat GPT and GitHub Actions! __If they are not funny, blame OpenAI__
 
Sure, here are four jokes related to software engineering and cyber security:

1. Why did the software developer go broke? Because he kept forgetting to CTRL+SHIFT+S (Save) his money!

2. Why did the hacker break up with their computer? It wasn't giving them enough space for a healthy relationship. 

3. Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!

4. Why did the cyber security expert bring a ladder to work? To scale the firewall and make sure there were no "loopholes"!
